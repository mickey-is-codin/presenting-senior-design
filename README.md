<h1>DTU Senior Design Project Presentation Material Repo</h1>

<h3>Project Introduction</h3>
<p>This repository contains all of the main documented code completed to fulfill Purdue University's Senior Design project requirements. The goal of the Denmark Team's senior design project was to characterize patient health using the <a href="https://www.empatica.com/en-gb/research/e4/">Empatica E4 smartwatch</a>. A full write-up of the report for this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/smit2300/PresentingSeniorDesign/tree/master/Report/final_paper.pdf">here</a>. Along with the report are accompanying <a href="https://github.com/smit2300/PresentingSeniorDesign/tree/master/report_slides.pdf">slides</a> used for the final presented proejct. The project is an amalgamation of Python web-scraping scripts, BASH scripts, Python signal processing, as well as MATLAB signal processing. These presentation materials mainly take the form of Jupyter notebooks, but one MATLAB-generated pdf document is included which outlines some of the signal processing efforts for the project.</p>

<p>The proof-of-concept notebooks in no particular order are: </p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="DataFetcher.ipynb">E4 Data Fetching Demonstration</a></li>
